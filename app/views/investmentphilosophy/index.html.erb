    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">Manchester Explorer, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), will focus on long positions in special situations where there may be limited downside risk because the General Partner believes that the company has been misvalued by the market. The Partnership will invest in stocks where there is a potential for a significant return in a 12 to 18 month time horizon.  The General Partner believes that well researched, concentrated investments in  exciting or misunderstood industries will provide an excellent return, generally independent of the S&P 500.  The Partnership will also use short sales to hedge its long positions in periods of market uncertainty and to opportunistically take advantage of catalyst driven situations likely to result in large declines in the value of companies.</p>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">Confidence in managements and their ability to execute is critical. Good managers should carry a premium if they have executed in the past, and a lack of market recognition of a manager’s background and industry view can provide a potential catalyst for investment.  The General Partner will endeavor to meet managements whenever possible prior to making an investment. Anecdotal information about the manager and insider buying and selling can also help in an evaluation of management credibility.</p>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">An ability to monitor the health of the company’s business is critical. The Partnership will attempt to have multiple sources of information within the company and in the industry to help in evaluating whether the company can execute the stated business plan.  This is helpful both in determining potential catalysts for upside and early warning of potential problems.  Such early detection of alterations in the business climate around a company or industry is a key aspect of the Partnership’s risk management and it will seek to avoid situations in which such detection is difficult or impossible.  Further bolstering this, the Partnership will only make investments in companies that meet its strict guidelines for valuation and quality, preferring to remain underinvested in periods where such investments cannot be identified.</p>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">Whenever possible, the Partnership will invest for the long term. These long term relationships have substantial benefits including a more candid relationship with management, insight on general industry trends, and excellent information on the company's competitors, customers, and suppliers which may provide additional information or investment opportunities.  In addition to management, the Partnership will also attempt to establish a relationship with major stockholders in order to provide more information.  If the Partnership has a good initial entry point, it should be able to maintain its long term positions through market corrections.</p>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">The General Partner will research a variety of special situations that seem undervalued.  The General Partner hopes to uncover some unusual characteristic or catalyst in a company that will allow it to become much more profitable or grow rapidly.  When Wall Street recognizes the catalyst, the stock price should appreciate.</p>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">Such special situations might include:</p>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">unique businesses that are undervalued because there are no public competitors or recognition of the industry;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">companies operating in rapidly growing industries that are overlooked because they are foreign or covered by analysts who have no expertise in the new industry;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">companies that have undervalued assets that may be easily monetized;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">a company for which a development in its business may allow it to compete much more effectively, which is unrecognized because the company is too small for investment banking business or because the advantage is not easy to quantify;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">a company that has new management that the General Partner knows from past experience or industry;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">a change in industry dynamics that leads to one company clearly profiting at the expense of others;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">a broken IPO, spin-off, discredited management, or a leveraged balance sheet has caused investors to overlook parts of the business that may have great potential. Some of the potential may be in high growth industries;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">newly merged companies that may have opportunities that are not recognized;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">companies that have undergone changes that may attract a new set of stockholders who are willing to pay a much higher price for the stock, such as momentum investors;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">companies which the General Partner has closely followed in the past where a new reason to invest has emerged. Such investments may be described as recycling old names because of the General Partner’s historical insight;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">companies with business strategies that should be successful based on the General Partner’s past experience and research. The General Partner believes investment themes and industry cycles repeat themselves;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">companies that are merger candidates in industries where economics require the largest players to buy smaller ones or where the company possesses assets that are needed and more readily exploitable by larger industry participants.</li>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">It is anticipated that the Partnership will invest primarily in publicly-traded  stocks, bonds, options and related instruments such as PIPEs.  However, in order to maintain flexibility and to capitalize on investment opportunities as they arise, the Partnership is not required to invest any particular percentage of its portfolio in any type of investment or region, and the amount of the Partnership's portfolio which is invested in any type of investment, which is long or short, or which is weighted in U.S. or non-U.S. investments or different sectors can change at any time based on the General Partner's assessment of market opportunities; provided that no single investment will exceed 20% of the net assets of the Partnership (measured at the time of purchase) and that illiquid investments in any instrument will not exceed 10% of the net assets of the Partnership (measured at the time of investment and valued at cost or the best reasonable determination of the Partnership).  Accordingly, the Partnership's investments may at any time include long or short positions in, U.S. or foreign, publicly traded or privately issued or negotiated common stocks, preferred stocks, stock warrants and rights, corporate debt, bonds, notes or other debentures or debt participations, convertible securities, options (purchased or written) and other securities or financial instruments.</p>
    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%;">There can be no assurance that the Partnership will achieve its investment objective.</p>
