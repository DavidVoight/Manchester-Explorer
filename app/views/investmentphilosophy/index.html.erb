    <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%">Manchester Explorer, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), will focus on long positions in special situations where there may be limited downside risk because the company has been misvalued by the market. The Partnership will invest in stocks where there is a potential for a significant return in a 12 to 18 month time horizon. The General Partner believes that well researched, concentrated investments in exciting or misunderstood industries will provide an excellent return, generally independent of the S&amp;P 500. The Partnership will also use short sales to hedge its long positions in periods of market uncertainty and to opportunistically take advantage of catalyst driven situations likely to result in large declines in the value of companies.</p>
  <p style="margin: 30px 200px 0px; font-size: 85%">It is anticipated that the Partnership will invest primarily in publicly-traded  stocks, bonds, options and related instruments such as PIPEs.  However, in order to maintain flexibility and to capitalize on investment opportunities as they arise, the Partnership is not required to invest any particular percentage of its portfolio in any type of investment or region, and the amount of the Partnership's portfolio which is invested in any type of investment, which is long or short, or which is weighted in U.S. or non-U.S. investments or different sectors can change at any time based on the General Partner's assessment of market opportunities; provided that no single investment will exceed 20% of the net assets of the Partnership (measured at the time of purchase) and that illiquid investments in any instrument will not exceed 10% of the net assets of the Partnership (measured at the time of investment and valued at cost or the best reasonable determination of the Partnership).  Accordingly, the Partnership's investments may at any time include long or short positions in, U.S. or foreign, publicly traded or privately issued or negotiated common stocks, preferred stocks, stock warrants and rights, corporate debt, bonds, notes or other debentures or debt participations, convertible securities, options (purchased or written) and other securities or financial instruments.</p>
